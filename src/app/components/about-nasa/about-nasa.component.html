         <p class="description">The planet Mars has been explored remotely by spacecraft. Probes sent from Earth,
            beginning in the late 20th century, have yielded a large increase in knowledge about the Martian system,
            focused primarily on understanding its geology and habitability potential.

            Engineering interplanetary journeys is complicated and the exploration of Mars has experienced a high failure rate,
            especially the early attempts. Roughly sixty percent of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before completing their
            missions and some failed before their observations could begin.
         </p>
         <p class="description" title="Source: Wikipedia">
            Some missions have met with unexpected success, such as
            the twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity which operated for years beyond their specification.
